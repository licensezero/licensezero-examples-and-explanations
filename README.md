# License Zero Examples & Explanations

[License Zero][licensezero.com] offers a choice of new [public licenses] for your projects.  [Parity] requires others to release software they build with your work.  [Prosperity] limits commercial use of your software to a trial period.  [licensezero.com] can help you sell [standardized private licenses][private license] with permission for closed, proprietary software and commercial use to specific developers, one at a time.

Which public license is right for your software project?

Will selling private licenses through [licensezero.com] work for your project?

Your first source of answers is the [official guide][guide].  As a supplement to the guide, [`EXAMPLES.md`](./EXAMPLES.md) lists a number of well known open-source software projects and use cases, with notes on how they would play out under Parity, Prosperity, and standardized private licenses.  You can use those examples to check your reading of the licenses, and get a better sense of which public license will work best for your specific project.

___Reading these examples without reading [Parity] and [Prosperity] for yourself is a big, dangerous mistake.___

Hours and hours of work, plus tons of inside and outside feedback, went into making the licenses short, simple, and easy to read.  Whether you're deciding which license to use, or handling a dispute with someone you think isn't following your rules, the single source of truth is the text of the license you choose, not these examples or the guide.

[Parity] and [Prosperity] are only about as long as this `README`.  Read them first!
